   - 4-tier licensing active
   - Grace period managed (12 months)

3. **Revenue Pipeline:**
   - Target: 3-5 licensing discussions in 90 days
   - Goal: 1-2 deals closed
   - Conservative outcome: $50K-100K
   - Moderate outcome: $150K-300K

4. **Movement Launch:**
   - Solaris Framework available to all inventors
   - Your success proves the model
