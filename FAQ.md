# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

**Quick answers to common questions about Solaris Framework**

---

## General Questions

### What is Solaris Framework?

A complete IP protection system for independent inventors that costs $0 and includes:
- Templates for establishing prior art
- 4-tier licensing model (fair terms for everyone)
- Guides for patents, negotiation, community building
- Legal information and resources

**Goal:** Help inventors protect their work without expensive lawyers.

### Who created this?

**David Edward Sproule** - Independent inventor from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Created because the current IP system is broken (patents cost $60K-130K, trolls exploit inventors, corporations hoard knowledge).

### Is this really free?

**YES!** The framework itself is free (CC BY-SA 4.0 license).

You can:
- Use all templates
- Follow all guides
- Establish prior art on GitHub (free)
- License your invention using Solaris terms

**Only cost:** If you choose to file patents later ($60K-130K), but that's optional.

### Is this legal advice?

**NO.** This framework provides:
- Templates and information
- General guidance on IP protection
- Community resources

**For legal advice:** Consult a qualified patent attorney or agent.

## Prior Art & Protection

### How does public disclosure protect me?

**Prior art blocks others from patenting YOUR invention:**

1. You disclose on GitHub (dated, public, permanent)
2. Troll tries to patent YOUR invention later
3. Patent examiner searches prior art
4. Finds YOUR disclosure (dated earlier)
5. Rejects troll's application

**Your cost:** $0  
**Troll's cost:** $15K wasted  
**Your protection:** Complete ✅

### Won't public disclosure destroy my patent rights?

**Depends on country:**

**US/Canada:** 12-month grace period
- Disclose January 1, 2026
- Can file patents until January 1, 2027
- Grace period protects you

**Europe/Asia:** No grace period (generally)
- Public disclosure = no patents
- But prior art still blocks trolls
- Trade-off: Free protection vs. patent rights

See [LEGAL/Grace_periods_explained.md](LEGAL/Grace_periods_explained.md).

### What if someone uses my invention without licensing?

**Tier 4 (free) use is allowed IF:**
- Non-commercial (research, education, personal)
- They cite you

**Commercial use requires license (Tiers 1-3):**
- If they use without license: Breach of terms
- You can: Send cease & desist, negotiate license, sue
- Community defense fund helps with legal costs

### Do I need to file patents?

**NO!** Patents are optional.

**Without patents:**
- ✅ Prior art protects you from trolls
- ✅ Licensing revenue (based on contract, not patents)
- ✅ Community defense against infringement
- ❌ Can't sue for infringement (no patent to enforce)

**With patents:**
- ✅ All the above
- ✅ Can sue infringers
- ✅ Stronger negotiating position
- ❌ Costs $60K-130K

**For most inventors:** Prior art + licensing is enough.

## Licensing Questions

### How do the 4 tiers work?

**Tier 4 (Free):** Research, education, personal use - $0, just cite me

**Tier 2 (Mission-Aligned):** Companies helping humanity - $10K-100K + 1-3% royalty + share improvements

**Tier 1 (Pioneer):** World-changing missions (SpaceX, Neuralink) - Low fee + help with patents = zero royalties

**Tier 3 (Commercial):** For-profit companies - $100K-1M + 3-5% royalty

**Customizable:** You can adjust fees/royalties for your situation.

### Why would companies pay if it's publicly disclosed?

**Because licensing is:**
- **Faster:** 18-24 months saved vs. developing themselves
- **Cheaper:** $100K license vs. $1M-10M R&D cost
- **Lower risk:** Proven technology vs. experimental
- **Legal cover:** Licensed use = safe from litigation
- **Improvements:** Get updates from other licensees
- **Reputation:** "We support fair innovation"

**Analogy:** Linux is free (open source), yet Red Hat makes $3B+/year selling Linux support.

### How do I negotiate licenses?

**Steps:**
1. Company emails you (interested in licensing)
2. You identify their tier (mission, resources)
3. You propose terms (fee, royalty, timeline)
4. They counter-offer (negotiate details)
5. You agree on fair terms
6. Sign simple 2-3 page agreement
7. They pay, you deliver (docs, support, etc.)

See [GUIDES/How_to_negotiate_licenses.md](GUIDES/How_to_negotiate_licenses.md).

### What if someone violates Tier 4 (free) by commercializing?

**Action:**
1. Send friendly email: "Hey, you need to upgrade to Tier 3"
2. If they comply: Great! Negotiate Tier 3 terms
3. If they refuse: Cease & desist letter
4. If still refuse: Community defense fund, legal action

**Most comply at step 1-2** (cheaper than legal fight).

## Technical Questions

### What kind of inventions work with Solaris?

**Any invention!**

**Examples:**
- Software (algorithms, apps, protocols)
- Hardware (devices, circuits, mechanisms)
- Chemical (materials, compounds, processes)
- Biological (genetic sequences, organisms)
- Business methods (novel processes)
- Design (novel appearances)

**If you invented it, Solaris can protect it.**

### Can I use this for software?

**YES!** Solaris works great for software:

**Copyright:** Protects code (automatic)
**Patents:** Protects algorithms/methods (optional)
**Licensing:** 4-tier model (free for non-commercial, licensed for commercial)

**Example:** "I built a novel ML algorithm. I release code under Apache 2.0 (Tier 4 free for research), but commercial use requires Tier 2-3 license."

### Can I keep some details secret (trade secrets)?

**YES!**

**Disclose:**
- Core concept (establishes prior art)
- High-level how it works
- Key advantages

**Keep secret:**
- Specific implementation details
- Manufacturing parameters
- Optimization tricks
- Licensees get secrets upon signing

**Example:**
- **Public:** "Phyllotactic pattern reduces crosstalk by 30%"
- **Secret:** "Specific coating formula and deposition temps"

### How detailed should my disclosure be?

**Enough for "person skilled in the art" to reproduce.**

**For software:** Pseudocode or conceptual algorithms (not full source)
**For hardware:** Diagrams, key components, how it works
**For chemical:** General composition, synthesis method
**For biological:** Sequence or organism description

**Don't worry about perfection!** You can update later. Important thing is establishing DATE.

## Philosophy & Ethics

### Why create this instead of keeping it proprietary?

**Because:**

1. **More impact:** Helping 1,000 inventors > Keeping secret
2. **Ecosystem:** More Solaris users = stronger community defense
3. **Legacy:** Change how innovation works > Personal profit
4. **Fairness:** Current system is broken, this fixes it

**Also:** By sharing, I prove the model works. Credibility attracts licensees to my own inventions.

### Isn't this just giving up my competitive advantage?

**No! Sharing the framework:**
- Helps others protect THEIR inventions (different from mine)
- Creates community that defends ME too (collective defense)
- Establishes me as thought leader (attracts opportunities)
- Proves model works (encourages licensing of MY tech)

**My competitive advantage is MY inventions**, not the framework.

### What about the ethical rules ("don't be a douchebag")?

**Enforceable through license terms:**

1. **If licensee violates ethics:** Breach of contract
2. **Inventor can terminate license:** No longer authorized to use
3. **Community enforcement:** Reputation matters (no one licenses to known bad actors)

**Specific violations:**
- Price gouging customers
- Exploiting workers
- Environmental harm
- Not compensating inventor fairly

### Can I adapt Solaris for my specific field?

**YES!** Encouraged!

**Examples:**
- "Solaris for Biotech" (specific to genetic sequences)
- "Solaris for Hardware" (specific to physical devices)
- "Solaris for Design" (specific to aesthetic innovations)

**Just maintain:**
- Core principle: Fair compensation based on mission and resources
- Ethical framework: Don't be a douchebag
- Open access: Free for research/education
- Credit: Acknowledge based on Solaris Framework

## Troubleshooting

### I disclosed but now realize I want to patent in Europe. What do I do?

**Bad news:** Public disclosure likely killed European patent rights (no grace period).

**Good news:**
- Can still file in US/Canada (12-month grace period)
- Prior art protects you globally (trolls can't patent)
- Can still license to European companies (don't need European patent)

**Lesson:** If Europe matters, file provisional BEFORE disclosure.

### Someone is claiming THEY invented my invention first. What do I do?

**Ask for proof:**
- What's their disclosure date?
- Where's their documentation?
- Can they prove earlier date than yours?

**If they have earlier date:** They win priority (but you can still use YOUR version)

**If they DON'T have proof:** Your GitHub timestamps prove YOUR priority

**If dispute escalates:** Consult patent attorney (community defense fund may help).

### A company wants to license but argues my terms are too high. What do I do?

**Options:**
1. **Negotiate:** Maybe they're right (startup with no funding vs. Google)
2. **Explain value:** "My tech saves you $5M in R&D, I'm asking $100K"
3. **Hold firm:** "These are my terms, take it or leave it"
4. **Walk away:** If they won't pay fair price, find someone who will

**Remember:** You set the terms. Don't let lowballers exploit you.

See [GUIDES/How_to_negotiate_licenses.md](GUIDES/How_to_negotiate_licenses.md).

### I can't afford patent filing ($60K-130K). What do I do?

**Options:**
1. **Provisional first:** File provisional DIY ($100-500), gives 12 months to raise money
2. **Use licensing revenue:** Get first license, use money to file patents
3. **Crowdfunding:** Kickstarter for patent fees (some succeed)
4. **Accept no patents:** Prior art + licensing still works (just can't sue infringers)
5. **Find partner:** Company pays patent costs in exchange for exclusive license

**Many successful inventors never file patents!** Licensing revenue + prior art protection is often enough.
