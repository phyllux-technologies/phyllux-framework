## ABSTRACT (50-150 words)

Brief summary of what your invention is and what problem it solves.

**Example:**
"PNM is a brain-computer interface electrode array that uses phyllotactic patterns and the golden angle (137.508°) to optimize electrode spacing. Unlike conventional grid arrays, PNM reduces signal crosstalk by 30%, improves signal quality by 40%, and minimizes tissue damage through biomimetic spacing. The design is scalable from 32 to 10,000+ electrodes and manufacturable using existing photolithography techniques."
