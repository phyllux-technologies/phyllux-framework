# Solaris Framework Templates

Use these templates for your inventions:

- **TEMPLATE_License_4Tier.md** - Copy this for your licensing terms
- **TEMPLATE_License_Agreement.md** - Agreement template for licensees
- **TEMPLATE_Prior_Art.md** - Prior art establishment template

---

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Choose the right template** for your needs:
   - Use `TEMPLATE_Prior_Art.md` first to establish public disclosure (prior art)
   - Use `TEMPLATE_License_4Tier.md` to define your licensing terms
   - Use `TEMPLATE_License_Agreement.md` when a company wants to sign a formal deal

2. **Fill in the templates:**
   - Replace all [bracketed items] with your information
   - Customize sections as needed (fees, territories, special terms)
   - Be specific in technical descriptions for strong prior art

3. **Upload to your GitHub repository:**
   - Create a public repository for your invention
   - Upload the filled templates
   - Commit with a message like: "Public disclosure and licensing terms - [Date]"
   - The GitHub timestamp becomes your permanent disclosure date

4. **Best practices:**
   - Make the repository public (required for prior art)
   - Add a LICENSE file (CC BY-SA 4.0 recommended for the framework itself)
   - Include good README with overview, how to license, and contact
   - Consider creating a release (v1.0) for extra timestamp protection

## Important Notes

- **Prior art strength** depends on detail: The more technical information you provide (how it works, components, advantages), the stronger the prior art.
- **Patents remain an option** in US/Canada for 12 months after public disclosure (grace period).
- **These are templates only** — customize them for your situation.
- **Not legal advice** — consult a patent attorney/agent for complex cases.
- **Framework license:** The templates themselves are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 (share-alike, attribution required).

## Why use these templates?

- **Free protection** — Public disclosure on GitHub blocks trolls from patenting your idea
- **Fair licensing** — 4-tier model makes it accessible to researchers while compensating you from commercial users
- **Simple agreements** — Easy-to-understand contracts for real licensing deals
- **Community building** — Public repos enable collaboration and credibility

**Good luck protecting and sharing your invention!**
