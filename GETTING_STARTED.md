**Total cost:** $0 (GitHub is free)  
**Legal protection:** Solid

Let's do this! 💪

---

## Prerequisites

**What you need:**

1. **An invention** (obviously!)
   - You've actually built or designed something
   - You can explain how it works
   - It's novel (not just copying existing products)

2. **Basic information:**
   - Your full legal name
   - Your location (city, country)
   - Your email address
   - Date you first conceived the invention (approximately)

3. **Technical details:**
   - Description of what it does
   - How it works (basic mechanism)
   - Why it's better than existing solutions
   - Optional: Code, diagrams, photos

4. **A GitHub account:**
   - Free at https://github.com/signup
   - Takes 2 minutes to create

**Don't have all this? That's okay!** You can start with what you have and refine later.

---

## Step 1: Download the Framework (5 minutes)

### Option A: Clone with Git (if you know Git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/solaris-framework.git
cd solaris-framework
```

### Option B: Download ZIP (easier)

1. Go to https://github.com/[USERNAME]/solaris-framework
2. Click green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Unzip to your computer
5. Open the folder

**You now have all the templates!** 📦

---

## Step 2: Create Your Invention Repository (5 minutes)

### On GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `your-invention-name` (use dashes, no spaces)
3. **Description:** "Brief one-line description of your invention"
4. **Public** (MUST be public for prior art!)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README yet (we'll add our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

### On Your Computer:

```bash
# Create local folder
mkdir your-invention-name
cd your-invention-name

# Initialize Git
git init

# Copy all templates from Solaris Framework
cp /path/to/solaris-framework/TEMPLATES/* .

# You now have blank templates ready to fill!
ls
```

**You should see:**
- PRIOR_ART_template.md
- INVENTION_DISCLOSURE_template.md
- PATENTS_template.md
- COPYRIGHT_template
- INVENTORSHIP_DECLARATION_template.md
- SOLARIS_LICENSE_template.md
- README_template.md

---

## Step 3: Fill in the Templates (60-90 minutes)

### 3.1 Start with PRIOR_ART_template.md

**What it does:** Legally establishes that YOU publicly disclosed this invention on THIS date.

**Open the file and replace:**

```markdown
[YOUR FULL NAME] → David Edward Sproule
[YOUR LOCATION] → Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
[YOUR EMAIL] → your.email@example.com
[YOUR GITHUB] → @yourusername
[TODAY'S DATE] → January 14, 2026
[INVENTION NAME] → My Amazing Invention
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION] → A new type of widget that solves problem X
```

**Important fields:**

- **First Public Disclosure:** Use today's date (this is when you're making it public!)
- **Repository URL:** https://github.com/yourusername/your-invention-name
- **Inventor Information:** Your real legal name (this is a legal document)

**Pro tip:** The date you upload to GitHub becomes your official disclosure date. Everything after today is protected!

### 3.2 Fill INVENTION_DISCLOSURE_template.md

**What it does:** Proves you actually invented this (not just an idea).

**Key sections to fill:**

**Title:**
```markdown
[DESCRIPTIVE TITLE OF INVENTION]
→ Example: "Phyllotactic Solar Panel Layout for Maximum Energy Capture"
```

**Technical Field:**
```markdown
This invention relates to [FIELD]
→ Example: "solar energy systems, specifically the spatial arrangement 
of photovoltaic panels for residential and commercial installations"
```

**Background (Problem):**
```markdown
Current systems have these problems:
- [PROBLEM 1]
- [PROBLEM 2]
- [PROBLEM 3]
```

**Summary (Your Solution):**
```markdown
My invention solves this by:
- [KEY INNOVATION 1]
- [KEY INNOVATION 2]
- Benefits: [SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS]
```

**Detailed Description:**
This is the meat! Explain:
- **How it works** (mechanism, process, system)
- **Key components** (parts, materials, software)
- **Why it's better** (quantified if possible: "30% more efficient")
- **How to build it** (enough detail that someone skilled could reproduce)

**Don't worry about perfection!** You can always update this later. The important thing is establishing the DATE.

### 3.3 Fill PATENTS_template.md

**What it does:** Reserves your right to file patents while allowing open-source use.

**Key replacements:**

```markdown
[YOUR NAME] → Your full name
[YOUR EMAIL] → your.email@example.com
[TECHNOLOGY NAME] → Your invention name
[FIRST DISCLOSURE DATE] → Today's date
[FILING DEADLINE] → Today + 12 months (if in US/Canada)
```

**Example:**
```markdown
First disclosure: January 14, 2026
US/Canada deadline: January 14, 2027 (12-month grace period)
```

**This file tells everyone:**
- ✅ They can use your code/documentation (Apache 2.0 license)
- ❌ They can't use your patentable inventions commercially without license
- ⏰ You have 12 months to file patents (don't miss this!)

### 3.4 Fill COPYRIGHT_template

**What it does:** Protects your code, documentation, and creative works.

**Simple replacements:**

```markdown
Copyright © [YEAR] [YOUR NAME]
→ Copyright © 2026 David Sproule

Email: [YOUR EMAIL]
→ Email: your.email@example.com
```

**That's it!** Copyright is automatic when you create something. This just makes it explicit.

### 3.5 Fill INVENTORSHIP_DECLARATION_template.md

**What it does:** Legal declaration that YOU are the sole inventor.

**Critical sections:**

**Inventor Information:**
```markdown
Full Legal Name: [YOUR FULL LEGAL NAME]
Citizenship: [YOUR CITIZENSHIP]
Residence: [YOUR FULL ADDRESS]
Email: [YOUR EMAIL]
```

**Invention Description:**
```markdown
Title: [INVENTION TITLE]
Description: [1-2 SENTENCE SUMMARY]
Date of Conception: [WHEN YOU FIRST HAD THE IDEA]
Date of Reduction to Practice: [WHEN YOU BUILT/CODED IT]
First Public Disclosure: [TODAY - WHEN YOU UPLOAD TO GITHUB]
```

**The Declaration:**
```markdown
I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true 
and correct.

Declared at: [YOUR CITY, COUNTRY]
Date: [TODAY'S DATE]
```

**Why this matters:** If anyone later claims THEY invented it, this document proves YOU did it first and publicly declared it.

### 3.6 Fill SOLARIS_LICENSE_template.md

**What it does:** Sets up the 4-tier licensing model.

**Replace throughout:**

```markdown
[YOUR NAME] → Your name
[YOUR EMAIL] → Your email
[INVENTION NAME] → Your invention
[YOUR GITHUB REPO] → https://github.com/yourusername/your-invention
```

**The tiers are already set up!** You can adjust:
- License fees (suggested: $10K-100K for Tier 2, $100K-1M for Tier 3)
- Royalty rates (suggested: 1-3% Tier 2, 3-5% Tier 3)
- Specific requirements

**Most inventors should keep the default terms.** They're fair and proven.

### 3.7 Fill README_template.md

**What it does:** This becomes your repository homepage.

**Key sections:**

**Title & Description:**
```markdown
# [INVENTION NAME]
> [ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION]

→ Example:
# Phyllotactic Solar Layout
> Nature-inspired panel arrangement for 20% more energy capture
```

**Features:**
```markdown
- ✨ [KEY FEATURE 1]
- ✨ [KEY FEATURE 2]
- ✨ [KEY FEATURE 3]
```

**Quick Start:**
```markdown
[HOW SOMEONE CAN USE YOUR INVENTION]
→ Installation instructions, usage examples, etc.
```

**Licensing:**
```markdown
This invention is available under Solaris Framework:
- 🎓 FREE for research/education
- 🤝 FAIR TERMS for mission-aligned orgs
- 💼 MARKET RATES for commercial use

See [SOLARIS_LICENSE.md](SOLARIS_LICENSE.md) for details.
```

## Step 4: Upload to GitHub (10 minutes)

### Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Link your local repo to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-invention-name.git
```

### Commit Your Files

```bash
# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "Initial disclosure under Solaris Framework

- Establish prior art (dated [TODAY])
- Complete technical disclosure
- 4-tier licensing model
- Copyright and patent rights reserved

Prior art established: [TODAY'S DATE]
Grace period deadline: [TODAY + 12 MONTHS]"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**If you get an error about "main" vs "master":**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Verify It's Live

1. Go to https://github.com/yourusername/your-invention-name
2. You should see all your files!
3. Check the commit timestamp (this is your official disclosure date)

**Congrats!** 🎉 Your invention is now publicly disclosed and protected!

---

## Step 5: Create a Release (Optional but Recommended, 5 minutes)

**Why:** GitHub Releases create a permanent snapshot with a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).

**How:**

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click "Releases" (right sidebar)
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. **Tag version:** v1.0.0
5. **Release title:** "Initial Public Disclosure"
6. **Description:**
   ```markdown
   First public disclosure of [INVENTION NAME] under Solaris Framework.
   
   Date: [TODAY]
   Prior art established.
   Grace period: 12 months for patent filing (US/Canada).
   
   All files are under Solaris licensing terms (4-tier model).
   ```
7. Click "Publish release"

**Bonus:** This makes your repo citable in academic papers!

---

## Step 6: Optional Enhancements (If You Have Time)

### Add Zenodo DOI (Permanent Archive)

1. Go to https://zenodo.org/
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Enable your repository
4. Zenodo automatically archives your releases
5. You get a DOI badge: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX.svg)]()

**Why:** Zenodo is CERN-backed permanent storage. Your work will outlive GitHub!

### Add to Internet Archive

1. Go to https://web.archive.org/save
2. Enter your GitHub repo URL
3. Click "Save Page"
4. Your repo is now archived independently

**Why:** If GitHub ever goes down, your prior art still exists!

### Enable Discussions

1. Go to your repo Settings
2. Check "Discussions"
3. This creates a community forum for your invention

**Why:** Users and potential licensees can ask questions publicly.

---

## Step 7: What Happens Next?

### Immediate (Today)

✅ **Prior art established** - Your disclosure date is locked in  
✅ **Copyright active** - Your creative works are protected  
✅ **Patent clock starts** - You have 12 months to file (US/Canada)  
✅ **Licensing available** - Companies can inquire about terms

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Incomplete Technical Disclosure

**Problem:** You describe what it does, but not HOW it works.  
**Fix:** Add enough detail that someone skilled in the field could reproduce it.  
**Why it matters:** Incomplete disclosure isn't valid prior art.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Private Repository

**Problem:** You upload to GitHub but set repo to "Private."  
**Fix:** MUST be public! That's what makes it prior art.  
**Why it matters:** Private = not disclosed = no protection.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Missing Disclosure Date

**Problem:** You forget to put the date in your documents.  
**Fix:** Date EVERYTHING. Git commits have timestamps too.  
**Why it matters:** Date proves you disclosed BEFORE anyone else.

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Backup Plan

**Problem:** You only have files on GitHub, nowhere else.  
**Fix:** Keep local copies, use Zenodo, use Internet Archive.  
**Why it matters:** If GitHub disappears, so does your prior art.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Forgetting Grace Period Deadline

**Problem:** You disclosed January 1, 2026 but don't file patents.  
**Fix:** Put deadline in your calendar: January 1, 2027 (US/Canada).  
**Why it matters:** After 12 months, you CAN'T file patents anymore.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know enough technical detail yet"

**Solution:** Start with what you know. Mark sections "[TO BE COMPLETED]". Update later.  
**Key:** Get the DATE established first. You can always add detail.

### "I can't afford patent filing ($60K-130K)"

**Solutions:**
1. **Provisional patent first** ($100-300 filing fee, DIY)
2. **Wait for licensing revenue** (use that money to file)
3. **Crowdfunding** (Kickstarter for patent fees)
4. **Patent agent payment plans** (some offer this)
5. **Accept that patents aren't required** (prior art still protects you)

### "What if my country doesn't have grace periods?"

**Bad news:** Most countries (Europe, Asia) have NO grace period. Public disclosure kills patent rights.  
**Good news:** Prior art still blocks trolls from patenting YOUR invention.  
**Options:**
1. **File provisional patent BEFORE disclosure** (in your country)
2. **Disclose in US/Canada** (get 12-month grace period there)
3. **Accept patents are only for US/Canada**

See [LEGAL/Grace_periods_explained.md](../LEGAL/Grace_periods_explained.md) for details.

### "Someone says they invented this first"

**Response:** Point to your GitHub commit timestamps. Ask them to prove THEIR earlier date.  
**If they have earlier date:** They win priority. But you can still use YOUR version (independent invention).  
**If they're lying:** Your dated prior art proves it. Consider consulting lawyer if big $.

### "A company wants to license but argues over terms"

**Remember:**
1. **These are YOUR terms.** Don't let them lowball you.
2. **But be flexible** on details (payment schedule, milestone-based, etc.)
3. **Mission matters.** Better terms for companies advancing humanity.
4. **Get it in writing.** Simple 2-3 page agreement is fine.

See [GUIDES/How_to_negotiate_licenses.md](../GUIDES/How_to_negotiate_licenses.md).
